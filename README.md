# reactstrap-cljs
ClojureScript wrapper for [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)

Makes use of the macros written for [bootstrap-cljs](https://github.com/luxbock/bootstrap-cljs), but replaces [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) with [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) as the base library. Brings Bootstrap 4 compatibility and more explicit state management.
